      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! In 2018, I graduated from Kansas State University with a B.S. in Apparel Marketing and currently work as an Associate Merchandiser for Staples Promotional Products. In my free time, I run a small fashion brand of t-shirts that I design and create out of my bedroom.</p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is working remotely for a brand that I care about. Or the even bigger dream of running my own agency that gives small businesses a headstart by providing them with quality branding, a clean and functional website, and any creative assets they may need. </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Growing up, I have always been interested in creating things. I taught myself basic code and middle school, then loved my web design classes in high school. Now, I want to expand on those skills and pair them with my graphic design abilities to help businesses. Businesses with cluttered websites need help getting their sites to the next level. I want to help them showcase their brand on their website, not using generic templates. I want to help others succeed and I want to create.</p>
